# eTSM-PSS7
eTSM-PSS7 is a research prototype for evaluating self-maintenance in large language models. It implements an external persona and memory exoskeleton with multi-timescale updates, enabling quantitative measurement of long-horizon consistency, contradiction resilience, and persona stability without modifying model weights.
